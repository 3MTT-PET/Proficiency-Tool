## Step-by-Step Guide for Curating Assessment Questions



## **Step 1: Understanding Bloom's Taxonomy**
**Introduction to Focused Use of Bloom's Taxonomy for MCQs:**

Dear Respondent, 

Bloom's Taxonomy, a foundational framework for categorising educational objectives and cognitive skills, guides us in assessing a broad spectrum of cognitive abilities. Our assessment is uniquely tailored to focus on four critical levels within this taxonomy, utilising the versatile format of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to evaluate everything from basic knowledge recall to sophisticated analytical thinking.

## **Your contribution within MCQ constraints:**
We seek your expertise to craft multiple-choice questions that effectively cover the following four levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. Your questions should aim to gauge a comprehensive range of cognitive skills, from foundational knowledge to advanced analytical abilities, all within the MCQ format:

1. **Remember (Knowledge):** Contribute questions that prompt candidates to recall and identify key technical concepts and terminologies. These questions might focus on definitions, terminology, and fundamental facts essential for establishing a baseline of knowledge.
1. **Understand (Comprehension):** Develop MCQs that assess comprehension of technical principles and processes. Questions should test the candidate's ability to interpret, compare, and explain the meanings behind vital technical concepts.
1. **Apply:** Create MCQs that pose scenarios requiring the application of technical knowledge in simulated real-world challenges. Questions at this level should examine the candidate's capacity to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations, such as predicting outcomes or solving specific problems.
1. **Analyse:** Design MCQs that demand the dissection and analysis of complex technical issues into their constituent parts. These questions should evaluate the ability to scrutinise information, identify relationships, and draw conclusions based on given data or scenarios.

**Guidance for MCQ Contributors:**

- **Context and Purpose:** Our goal is to compile an assessment that rigorously spans a range of cognitive abilities adeptly measured through the MCQ format. Your contributions are critical to achieving a balanced and comprehensive evaluation. Remember that most questions should directly relate to what is needed to excel at the job/task.
- **Creativity and Expertise:** While adhering to the MCQ format, we encourage you to utilise your subject matter expertise and creativity to devise insightful and challenging questions, pushing the boundaries of what MCQs can achieve in terms of depth and engagement.
- **Impact of Cognitive Skill Diversity:** By encompassing questions across these selected levels, our assessment will provide a robust reflection of candidates' technical acumen and problem-solving prowess, all through the focused lens of multiple-choice questioning. Also, kindly avoid tricky questions with no intent of assessing abilities.

Your participation is invaluable in developing an MCQ-based assessment tool that not only meets the rigorous standards of technical evaluation but also captures the diverse spectrum of cognitive skills necessary in the modern technical field. We are thankful for your contributions and look forward to incorporating your expertly crafted questions into our assessment framework.

## **Step 2: Aligning Assessments with Cognitive Levels**
**Rubric for Differentiating Entry-Level and Intermediate-Level Assessment Questions**

In response to our focused use of Bloom's Taxonomy for crafting multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that span foundational knowledge to advanced analytical thinking, we've established a rubric to guide the creation and evaluation of these questions, distinguishing between entry-level and intermediate-level cognitive skills. 

For **entry-level questions**, the rubric emphasises the ability to recall and comprehend fundamental concepts. Questions should be straightforward, focusing on direct recall of facts (Remember) and basic interpretation or explanation of ideas (Understand), suitable for candidates beginning their journey in the technical field.

Conversely, **intermediate-level questions,** encapsulating the Apply and Analyze levels, demand a deeper engagement with the material. These questions challenge candidates to apply their knowledge to solve problems in novel situations (Apply) and to dissect and explore complex scenarios, demonstrating a capacity for critical thinking and analysis (Analyze).

|**Criterion**|**Entry-Level Question**|**Intermediate-Level Question**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Knowledge and Understanding|Does the question assess foundational knowledge or basic understanding of concepts?|Does the question assess the application of knowledge in new or varied contexts?|
|Problem-Solving Skills|Is the question designed to evaluate the candidateâ€™s ability to remember and explain simple concepts and terminologies?|Is the question designed to evaluate analytical skills and the ability to integrate knowledge across different domains?|
|Complexity of Tasks|Does the question require the use of straightforward problem-solving skills on familiar tasks?|Does the question require problem-solving involving multiple steps, including the evaluation of alternatives?|
|Context and Information|Can the question be answered with limited context or information provided?|Can the question only be answered by synthesising information from multiple sources or contexts?|
|Question Format|Is the format of the question direct and to the point, without requiring interpretation or analysis of data?|<p>Does the format of the question allow for open-ended responses that demonstrate depth of understanding and critical thinking?</p><p></p><p></p>|

## **Step 3: Structuring the Document**
**1. Section Organization:**

**Skill and Competence Categories:** Begin by dividing your document into sections, each dedicated to a distinct skill or competency area you intend to assess. This categorisation helps maintain a structured and organised question pool.

**2. Question Categorization:**

**Domain, Topic, or Stack Tags:** For every question you create, assign specific tags that reflect the domain (e.g., Software Development, Data Science), topic (e.g., Object-Oriented Programming, Statistical Analysis), or technology stack (e.g., React, Node.js) it pertains to. This tagging system is crucial for:

- Streamlining the question search and retrieval process.
- Facilitating targeted assessments tailored to specific learning outcomes or job roles.
- Enabling dynamic grouping of questions for varied assessment needs.

**3. Document Naming and Organization:**

**Document Naming Convention:** Please name each document with a clear and descriptive title reflecting the skill area it addresses, following the format 3MTT\_QuestionPool\_[SkillArea] (e.g., 3MTT\_QuestionPool\_UIUX). This practice ensures:

- Easy identification and access to relevant question sets.
- Efficient management and updating of the question pool.

**Separate Documents for Each Skill Area:** Create separate documents for each when curating questions for multiple skill areas. This approach:

- Prevents confusion and overlap between different domains of knowledge.
- Facilitates the modular development of assessments, allowing for customisation and scalability.
- 
## Category 1 - Technical Skills:
