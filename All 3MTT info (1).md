## <a name="_2snbvq3681ej"></a>What is 3MTT?
The 3 Million Technical Talent (3MTT) programme, a critical part of the Renewed Hope agenda, is aimed at building Nigeria’s technical talent backbone to power our digital economy and position Nigeria as a net talent exporter. The first phase of the programme, executed in collaboration with NITDA, will involve multiple stakeholders including fellows, training providers, partners and placement organizations.

The first phase of the programme will be executed as a fellowship model in collaboration with NITDA. We will select individuals with interest in specific skills and fund the cost of their training with training providers accepted into the programme.

In line with the Ministry's 1%-10%-100% implementation approach, this first phase will aim to train and place 30,000 technical talents, representing 1% of our overall target. It will be executed based on the framework co-created with key stakeholders across government agencies, training providers, educational institutions, development agencies and the private sector.

The 3MTT programme by the Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation & Digital Economy will generate a pipeline of technical talent in line with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s vision of creating 2 million digital jobs by 2025.

The first phase of the programme started in November 2023 with 1% (i.e 30,000 fellows) technical talents (from the overall 3 million quota) from the 36 states and the FCT. Phase 2 of the programme is scheduled to begin in March 2024. Phase 2 will scale up to 10% - that is, 300,000 fellows. 

The phase 2 of the program is divided into 3 cohorts. Cohort 1 with 60,000 fellows, cohort 2 with 90,000 fellows and cohort 3 with 120,000 fellows, making it 270,000 fellows in all to be trained in phase 2. Adding the phase 2 numbers to phase 1 will make it 300,000 fellows - which is 10% of the 3 million technical talents to be trained.

## <a name="_dahgglm84or9"></a>LEARNING COMMUNITY


The 3mtt learning community facilitates collaboration and support amongst its members to learn together.

The 3MTT Learning Community is designed to provide learning opportunities, resources, and support for individuals interested in acquiring software development and technology skills in Nigeria. 

The 3MTT Learning Community consists of a network of people across Nigeria dedicated to learning how to develop their technical skills to solve social challenges around them. The learning community is designed to foster collaboration and support among its members to grow together.

3MTT learner applicants automatically become part of the 3MTT Learning community after registration. 

Learners can access learning resources on the Community page on the 3MTT platform after they create their accounts. 

Through the learning community, learners will also be able to connect with other learners in their community, attend technical events/workshops, and receive support from facilitators and mentors as they progress through their learning journey. 



Members of each learning community cluster will learn together, attend classes or events, participate in discussions, and work on projects (where necessary) together.



The benefits of participating in the 3MTT learning community include increasing your social connections to other fellows in your field of study, peer-to-peer support, increasing motivation to learn your course of choice, and attending events that will improve your technical level. Members of the learning community are part of those who will be in the next training phases as they scale (the 10% and the 100%) the 3mtt programme.



The 3MTT learning community is for everyone who applied for the 3MTT programme is automatically a part of the learning community

`  `Yes, fellows with different skill levels are part of the same learning community . When you are assigned to a learning community in your location, the information will be displayed on your community page with the 3mtt portal when you log in.

## <a name="_x87s8s14jzor"></a>TRAINING PROVIDER

We are actively exploring different models to create opportunities for training providers to access centers in their cities in collaboration with state governments. Additionally, we are developing a device financing model in partnership with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and financiers to facilitate fellows in acquiring the necessary devices. Nevertheless, if a provider can establish a partnership with a center equipped with the required resources for implementation, such collaboration would be highly appreciated.


Fellows are encouraged to strategize and contribute actively as a means of fostering their individual growth and prosperity. Concurrently, our team is in the process of strategizing to implement a comprehensive package of perks and benefits aimed at alleviating the challenges faced by our fellows. This initiative is geared towards enhancing their overall experience and facilitating a more supportive environment for their personal and professional development. We however do not have a clear timeline for when it will be activated.


The screening process for assessing fellows' commitment to the 3MTT program is structured to ensure a basic evaluation of their capabilities. Following the registration phase, each fellow is required to complete a short questionnaire. This questionnaire is specifically designed to assess not only their basic digital skills but also their overall aptitude. The responses gathered from this questionnaire play a crucial role in gauging the fellows' commitment levels and suitability for active participation in the program.

We strongly encourage training providers to adopt strategic pedagogical approaches. It is pivotal for providers to implement customized strategies that cater to the specific needs and skill levels of matched fellows. This could involve supplementary training sessions, targeted skill-building exercises, and personalized support mechanisms.

Training providers hold responsibility for managing their WhatsApp group. They are required to validate the registration status of their fellows by cross-referencing with the records provided to them, and subsequently, they should remove any numbers on the platform that are unrecognized or unregistered

As a training provider, it is crucial to employ a comprehensive set of monitoring mechanisms to guarantee the achievement of learning goals. This involves verifying that fellows actively participate in online courses, attend physical sessions, and diligently complete their assignments and projects.


Any concerns regarding attendance should be clearly communicated to the 3MTT team through the designated reporting channel. Additionally, it is recommended that the provider employs a variety of approaches to actively engage and foster commitment among fellows in the program.


## <a name="_wonz7ctzs6u9"></a>What is the 3MTT “My Career in Tech” Webinar about?

The 3MTT webinar is an informative panel discussion between guest speakers, who are successful Nigerian professionals in the tech industry and a moderator who leads the conversation. The purpose of the webinar is for the guest speakers to offer insight from their experience in the industry and advice to fellows and learning community members who are just embarking on their journeys in the tech industry. The overarching goal of the webinar is to get the fellows in the best position to be employed into their dream tech jobs. The webinar takes place weekly on Friday’s at 4:00pm live on the FMCIDE Youtube page https://www.youtube.com/@FMCIDENigeria and each series is an hour long. Fellows and Learning Community members are also encouraged to ask the guest speakers questions and provide us with feedback as to what topics they would like to be discussed

## <a name="_1gbtikha4za1"></a>What is the purpose of the 3MTT incentives?

The 3MTT incentives provides a platform for fellows and learning community members to interact with each other and share what they have learnt or built since they started their respective courses. Events such as Hackathons, Innovation challenges and much more are also on offer. Fellows and learning community members who take part in these incentives stand the chance in winning tech prizes, but most importantly they put themselves in a very good position to be recognised by potential employers.
