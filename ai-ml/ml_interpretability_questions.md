# Model Interpretability Questions
## Question 1

**Question:** You are developing a machine learning model to predict loan default likelihood. The stakeholders require understanding how the model makes its predictions to make informed decisions.
What technique would you use to improve the stakeholders' understanding of your model's predictions?

A) Increase the complexity of the model to capture more nuanced patterns in the data.

B) Use a black-box model with the highest accuracy, assuming that interpretability is less important.

C) Implement a feature importance technique to highlight which features most influence the model's predictions.

D) Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to the most significant features only, without explaining their impact on the model.

**Correct Answer:** C

## Question 2

**Question:** Your model predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a new service. A customer who was predicted not to subscribe is asking for the reasons behind this prediction.
Which approach would you take to explain the specific prediction for this customer?

A) Use global feature importance to explain the general behavior of the model.

B) Apply a model-agnostic interpretability technique like LIME to explain the individual prediction.

C) Increase the model's accuracy by tuning hyperparameters without providing a specific explanation.

D) Simplify the model to a linear regression, assuming it will inherently make the reasoning clear.

**Correct Answer:** B

## Question 3

**Question:** You have developed a model to predict patient readmission risk. The healthcare professionals ask for explanations of the predictions to tailor their patient care plans.
What would be the most effective method to ensure the model's decisions are interpretable by healthcare professionals?

A) Rely on accuracy metrics to validate the model's effectiveness without providing explanations for its decisions.

B) Employ a deep learning model for its ability to handle complex datasets, disregarding interpretability.

C) Focus solely on improving the model's AUC score, considering interpretability to be a secondary concern.

D) Utilize SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to explain the effect of each feature on individual predictions.

**Correct Answer:** D

## Question 4

**Question:** Your model predicts credit scores based on personal financial data. There's a concern about the model potentially exhibiting bias against certain groups.
Which step would you include in your model development process to identify and mitigate bias?

A) Implement a complex model to minimize any bias in predictions through sophisticated algorithms.

B) Exclude sensitive features like race and gender, assuming this will automatically prevent bias.

C) Analyze model predictions across different groups to check for consistent performance and fairness. 

D) Use only numerical features since they are less likely to introduce bias into the model.

**Correct Answer:** C

## Question 5

**Question:** After developing a predictive maintenance model for manufacturing equipment, you need to present the model insights to non-technical stakeholders.
How would you effectively communicate the model's insights to ensure understanding and actionable decisions?

A) Present detailed model metrics like RMSE and confusion matrices, assuming stakeholders have the background to understand them.

B) Provide a high-level summary of model performance without delving into how predictions are made.

C) Use visual explanations (e.g., decision trees, feature importance charts) to convey how model predictions are derived.

D) Focus solely on the model's technical architecture, including layers and neurons, for a comprehensive understanding.

**Correct Answer:** C
