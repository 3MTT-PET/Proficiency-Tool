# Large Language Model Engineering Questions

## Question 1

**Question:** You are working on deploying a large language model for a chatbot application. Due to resource constraints, the model needs to be optimized for both speed and accuracy.
What approach would you consider first to optimize the model's performance without significant loss in accuracy?

A) Increase the model size to improve its understanding and generation capabilities.

B) Apply quantization techniques to reduce the model size and improve inference speed.

C) Use a simpler tokenization method to reduce the complexity of the model's input processing.

D) Manually rewrite the model's most complex layers to improve computational efficiency.

**Correct Answer:** B

## Question 2

**Question:** After deploying a large language model for content generation, you observe that its performance degrades over time due to changes in user preferences and language use, a phenomenon known as data drift.
What strategy would you employ to mitigate the effects of data drift on your deployed language model?

A) Periodically retrain the model on updated datasets that reflect current language usage and user preferences.

B) Increase the model's size to capture a wider range of language patterns and user preferences.

C) Deploy a fixed version of the model without updates, assuming that language change is slow and gradual.

D) Implement an automated feedback loop where the model self-corrects based on user interactions.

**Correct Answer:** A

## Question 3

**Question:** You're integrating a large language model into a real-time customer service chat application. The application requires low latency to ensure user satisfaction, but the model's response time is currently above the desired threshold.
What technique would you apply to decrease the response time of the language model in a real-time application environment?

A) Deploy the model on more powerful hardware with better CPU and GPU capabilities.

B) Break down the model into smaller, independently functioning modules that handle parts of the conversation.

C) Implement caching mechanisms for frequently asked questions to reduce the model's workload.

D) Increase the batch size for inference requests to process more user queries in parallel.

**Correct Answer:** C

## Question 4

**Question:** You are fine-tuning a pre-trained large language model for legal document analysis. The goal is to improve the model's performance on legal terminology and document structure understanding.
Which fine-tuning approach is most suitable for adapting a general-purpose language model to specialize in legal document analysis?

A) Continuously train the model on a large, general corpus to improve its overall linguistic capabilities.

B) Fine-tune the model on a diverse set of domains with a focus on legal documents in the final training phase.

C) Use transfer learning from models trained on medical documents, given the similar complexity of language.

D) Fine-tune the model exclusively on a curated legal document dataset to specialize its knowledge.

**Correct Answer:** D

## Question 5

**Question:** Before deploying a large language model in a public-facing application, there are concerns about the model potentially generating biased or harmful content.
What preemptive action would you take to address these ethical concerns?

A) Implementing strict rate limits on the model's API to prevent misuse.

B) Developing a comprehensive filtering layer to screen and modify any biased or harmful outputs.

C) Relying on user feedback post-deployment to identify and correct any issues with bias or harmful outputs.

D) Excluding sensitive topics from the model's training dataset to ensure it cannot generate content on those topics.

**Correct Answer:** B
